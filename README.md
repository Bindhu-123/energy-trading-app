⚡ Energy Trading App

A decentralized platform that enables buyers and sellers of renewable energy to connect, trade, and manage transactions seamlessly. 
The app focuses on transparency, fair pricing, and sustainability.

📖 Overview

   Our idea is a decentralized platform where solar panel owners can sell their extra energy directly to buyers.
   We’ve built buyer and seller dashboards,integrated blockchain payments with MetaMask, and connected it to a 
   MySQL backend — making energy trading transparent, secure, and future-ready.”

🌟 Features

   🔑 User Authentication – Buyer & Seller login
   📊 Dashboard – Track energy usage and transactions
   🌱 Carbon Footprint Tracking – View environmental impact
   🛒 Marketplace – Sellers can list energy units, buyers can purchase
   🎮 Gamification – Rewards for sustainable practices
   ⚙️ Admin Panel – Manage users and transactions

🏗️ Tech Stack

   1. Frontend → HTML, CSS, JavaScript
   2. Backend → JSON + MySQL (handled in XAMPP environment)
   3. Blockchain → MetaMask (simulating peer-to-peer energy transactions)
   4. Hosting / Server → XAMPP (Apache + MySQL)

❓ Why This Problem?

   1. Energy demand is rising
   2. Renewable adoption is growing, but trading is inefficient
   3. Decentralization empowers both producers & consumers
   4. Direct peer-to-peer trading can reduce costs & increase transparency

👉 Proposed Solution

   1. A decentralized platformfor solar energy trading
   2. Buyerscan directly purchase energy from sellers (solar panel owners)
   3. Secure login system with role-based dashboards (Buyer / Seller)
   4. Transparent energy transaction records for trust & accountability
   5. Scalable for integration with smart grids in the future

🌍 Environmental Impact

   1. Encourages renewable energy adoption
   2. Reduces carbon emissions by promoting clean energy usage
   3. Empowers local producers to contribute to a sustainable energy ecosystem
   4. Supports global climate action goals

 🚀 Future Plans

   ☁️ Cloud Deployment – Host the app on cloud servers (AWS / Azure / Heroku) for real-world accessibility.
   🔒 Advanced Security – Add authentication (JWT/OAuth) and role-based access control. 
   📱 Mobile App Version – Extend functionality to Android/iOS for wider adoption.
   🌍 Scalability – Expand the platform to support community microgrids and peer-to-peer energy networks.
